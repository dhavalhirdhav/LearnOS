# LearnOS
## Introduction
This has been one of my dream project which I have been planning to do since a very long. Since the day I was introduced to programming it has been my dream to develop my own full fledge operating system. In the past for work purpose I have developed micro OSes, which had its own File System but no GUI, and they were designed for very specific purpose, so it did not have whole lot of things.

I always like to share my knowledge with everyone around. So I have decided to make my project open source.. at present I am not allowing anyone to contribute to the project, but anyone is free to fork it, clone it and use it.

## Checklist

- [x] Boot loader
