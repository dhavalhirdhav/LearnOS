# LearnOS
## Introduction
This has been one of my dream project which I have been planning to do since a very long. Since the day I was introduced to programming it has been my dream to develop my own full fledge operating system. In the past for work purpose I have developed micro OSes, which had its own File System but no GUI, and they were designed for very specific purpose, so it did not have whole lot of things.

I always like to share my knowledge with everyone around. So I have decided to make my project open source.. at present I am not allowing anyone to contribute to the project, but anyone is free to fork it, clone it and use it.

## Checklist

I am planning to develop many features in this operating system, some of the features which I have thought are as follows:

1. Boot loader
2. Kernel
3. Itâ€™s own File System
4. Multi-Threading / Multi-Tasking
5. Ability to read and write FAT and FAT 32 File System
6. GUI (Support for Keyboard and Mouse)
7. Painting application
8. Audio System and ability to play WAV, MP3, 3gp files.
9. Network stack
10. TCP/IP
11. Sockets
12. Browser
13. Development Tools (Compiler, and maybe own language)
14. Communication with GPU
15. Printer support
16. WiFi and Bluetooth support
17. APIs (External Application development support)
18. Pen Drive Auto Mount Support
19. Couple of Games
20. Development Environment (IDE)
